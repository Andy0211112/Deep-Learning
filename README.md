# Deep Learning Models: MLP, RNN, CNN, and Transformer

## 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
### Structure
- **Input Layer**: Receives the input data.
- **Hidden Layers**: One or more layers of neurons, each fully connected to the previous layer.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final output.

### Use Cases
- Suitable for simple classification and regression tasks.

### Limitations
- Not effective for handling sequential or spatial data.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
### Structure
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to extract features from the input.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform the final classification.

### Use Cases
- Primarily used for image processing tasks like image classification and object detection.

### Advantages
- Efficiently captures spatial hierarchies in images through local connections and shared weights.

## 3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
### Structure
- **Recurrent Layers**: Neurons have connections to previous time steps, allowing information to persist.

### Use Cases
- Ideal for sequential data such as time series analysis and natural language processing.

### Challenges
- Prone to vanishing and exploding gradient problems, making it difficult to learn long-term dependencies.

## 4. Transformer
### Structure
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences.

### Use Cases
- Excels in tasks involving sequential data, especially in natural language processing like machine translation.

### Advantages
- Can handle long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs.
- Allows for parallel processing of sequence data, improving computational efficiency.

### Key Components
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of each element in the sequence.

## Summary
- **MLP**: Basic feedforward network, not suitable for sequential data.
- **CNN**: Great for image processing with spatial hierarchies.
- **RNN**: Good for sequential data but struggles with long-term dependencies.
- **Transformer**: Efficiently handles long-range dependencies and parallel processing of sequences.
